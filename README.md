# GraphQL Book Search

  

  # Description
  
  A React app Book Search "engine" using Google Books API to handle GET requests when searching for book titles. Apollo GraphQL is used for handling user data i.e. signing/logging a user, saving the list of books and removing books from their saved list. JWT authentication is used when signing or logging in a user. Apollo GraphQL saved books are cached to make it quicker to remove books from your list as opposed to making network calls to the database. The database used is MongoDB.
